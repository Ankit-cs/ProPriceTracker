# ProPriceTracker - Advanced E-Commerce Price Monitor

**Live Demo:** [https://khareedley.vercel.app](https://buykarley.vercel.app)

ProPriceTracker is an intelligent and automated price tracking application that allows users to monitor product prices across various e-commerce platforms. Built with a modern Next.js stack, it uses Firecrawl for structured scraping, Supabase for scalable backend operations, and Resend for transactional email alerts.

## Key Features

- 🛒 **Universal Tracking:** Monitor items from Amazon (using ScrapingAnt) and other sites like BestBuy, Zara, Walmart (via Firecrawl).
- 📊 **Detailed Amazon Metadata:** Extracts and displays star ratings, review counts, popularity scores, choice badges, ASIN numbers, and collapsible features/descriptions.
- 📈 **Price Trends & Alerts:** Visualize history with interactive charts, toggle price alerts, and receive email notifications on price drops.
- ⚡ **[NEW] Signalist Trading Desk:** Build "Dream Setups" (Portfolios) with real-time price tracking. Includes technical indicators like Moving Average, Volatility %, Sentiment Scores, and "Buy/Wait" signals for products.
- 🟢 **[NEW] Real-time Flashes:** UI instantly flashes green or red via Supabase WebSockets the moment a price changes in the backend.
- 🔒 **Dynamic Auth / Dev Bypass:** Secure Google OAuth integration, with a built-in `BYPASS_AUTH` toggle for frictionless local sandbox testing.
- 🤖 **Automated Checks:** Daily cron jobs check tracked products and notify users of drop alerts.

## ⚡ Signalist Trading Desk (`/signalist`)

The **Signalist Trading Desk** is an advanced sub-module designed for users who want to group products into logical tracking portfolios (e.g., "Gaming PC Build", "Smart Home Upgrades") and monitor their aggregate value with algorithmic trading indicators.

### Desk Features:
- **Dream Setups (Portfolios):** Create unlimited, named portfolios and attach products to them. The card instantly calculates and displays the total aggregated cost of the setup.
- **Instant Product Syncing:** Add tracked products from a dropdown, or paste a brand-new Amazon URL directly into the setup. The app will automatically scrape it, track it, and wire it into the setup without needing a page refresh.
- **Optimistic UI:** Products can be removed from portfolios instantly via a hover-action minus button. The UI updates optimistically while the server processes the deletion.
- **Real-Time Flashes (WebSockets):** Using Supabase Realtime channels, the Trading Desk listens for database-level price updates. The moment a price changes (via a cron job or manual refresh), the `Total Value` of the setup and the individual product cards briefly flash **Green** (for price drops) or **Red** (for price increases) for 3 seconds.
- **Technical Analysis Indicators:**
  - **Moving Average (30-day):** Calculates the recent price trend to determine if the current price is a good entry point.
  - **Volatility Index:** A percentage metric showing how heavily the product's price fluctuates.
  - **AI Signals:** Automatically labels each product with actionable advice: `Strong Buy`, `Wait`, or `Neutral` based on the delta between the current price and its moving average.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js (App Router), React, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Recharts
- **Backend:** Next.js Server Actions & API Routes, Supabase (PostgreSQL, pg_cron)
- **[NEW] Side-by-Side Product Comparison**: Select up to 3 products to compare their prices, ratings, and features simultaneously using a persistent Zustand store.
- **[NEW] Signalist Trading Desk**: Build custom portfolios and get live AI-driven "Buy/Wait" signals, complete with optimistic instant UI updates for adding/removing items.
- **[NEW] Deep Discount Dashboard**: A dedicated interface that exclusively surfaces items currently on sale, sorted by the highest discount percentage.
- **[NEW] Sales Calendar & Savings Predictor**: An interactive tool that calculates potential savings by delaying purchases until major upcoming e-commerce events (e.g., Prime Day, Black Friday).
- **[NEW] Intelligent "Product Details" Parser**: Automatically scrapes the "Technical Details" section from Amazon into a structured JSON map (Key-Value pairs), stripping out messy HTML and emojis.
- **[NEW] Command Palette (⌘K)**: Instantly jump between features using the global `cmdk` search menu.
- **Extraction APIs:** 
  - **ScrapingAnt Client:** Advanced Amazon scraper using regional proxy routing (US, IN, GB, DE, FR, JP) and automatic bot-detection bypass.
  - **Firecrawl Client:** General e-commerce scraper for other sites.
- **Notifications:** Resend (Email Delivery)

## Local Development & Testing

### 1. Bypassing Authentication
To run and test the application locally without setting up Google OAuth or signing in:
1. In [actions.tsx](file:///c:/price/ProPriceTracker/app/actions.tsx), set `BYPASS_AUTH = true`.
2. When active, the application bypasses standard auth. It calls `getMockUser()`, which resolves the first user ID in your database to satisfy PostgreSQL foreign key constraints, and queries Supabase using a service role client to bypass Row-Level Security (RLS) rules.

### 2. Migrating Existing Products
If you have products already tracked in your database that lack rating, review, or description metadata:
1. Run `node migrate.js` to ensure the Supabase schema has all required columns.
2. Start the dev server (`npm run dev`).
3. Visit `http://localhost:3000/api/update-products` in your browser. 
4. The API will perform clean canonical scraping on all your existing rows and save their reviews, ratings, descriptions, and original prices back to the database.
